## BIDS-connectivity example for myconnectome dataset

This is an example of one session of functional connectivity data from the MyConnectome project, based on the raw data in [OpenNeuro ds000031](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000031).  This example follows (roughly) the scheme outlined in [BIDS BEP017](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugBdUF6dhElXdj3u9vw0iWjE6f_Bibsro3ah7sRV0GA/edit#).

The files currently contain data; before uploading to BIDS-examples, the files will be emptied to save space.
